    "Formula 1 Qualifying Rules": "For much of the sport's history, qualifying sessions differed little from practice sessions; drivers would have one or more sessions in which to set their fastest time, with the grid order determined by each driver's best single lap, with the fastest getting first place on the grid, referred to as pole position. From 1996 to 2002, the format was a one-hour shootout. This approach lasted until the end of 2002 before the rules were changed again because the teams were not running in the early part of the session to take advantage of better track conditions later on.\n\nGrids were generally limited to 26 cars – if the race had more entries, qualification would also decide which drivers would start the race. During the early 1990s, the number of entries was so high that the worst-performing teams had to enter a pre-qualifying session, with the fastest cars allowed through to the main qualifying session. The qualifying format began to change in the early 2000s, with the FIA experimenting with limiting the number of laps, determining the aggregate time over two sessions, and allowing each driver only one qualifying lap.\n\nThe current qualifying system was adopted in the 2006 season. Known as \"knock-out\" qualifying, it is split into three periods, known as Q1, Q2, and Q3. In each period, drivers run qualifying laps to attempt to advance to the next period, with the slowest drivers being \"knocked out\" of qualification (but not necessarily the race) at the end of the period and their grid positions set within the rearmost five based on their best lap times. Drivers are allowed as many laps as they wish within each period. After each period, all times are reset, and only a driver's fastest lap in that period (barring infractions) counts. Any timed lap started before the end of that period may be completed and will count toward that driver's placement. The number of cars eliminated in each period is dependent on the total number of cars entered into the championship.\n\nCurrently, with 20 cars, Q1 runs for 18 minutes, and eliminates the slowest five drivers. During this period, any driver whose best lap takes longer than 107% of the fastest time in Q1 will not be allowed to start the race without permission from the stewards. Otherwise, all drivers proceed to the race albeit in the worst starting positions. This rule does not affect drivers in Q2 or Q3. In Q2, the 15 remaining drivers have 15 minutes to set one of the ten fastest times and proceed to the next period. Finally, Q3 lasts 12 minutes and sees the remaining ten drivers decide the first ten grid positions. At the beginning of the 2016 Formula 1 season, the FIA introduced a new qualifying format, whereby drivers were knocked out every 90 seconds after a certain amount of time had passed in each session. The aim was to mix up grid positions for the race, but due to unpopularity, the FIA reverted to the above qualifying format for the Chinese GP, after running the format for only two races.\n\nEach car is allocated one set of the softest tyres for use in Q3. The cars that qualify for Q3 must return them after Q3; the cars that do not qualify for Q3 can use them during the race. As of 2022, all drivers are given a free choice of tyre to use at the start of the Grand Prix, whereas in previous years only the drivers that did not participate in Q3 had free tyre choice for the start of the race. Any penalties that affect grid position are applied at the end of qualifying. Grid penalties can be applied for driving infractions in the previous or current Grand Prix, or for changing a gearbox or engine component. If a car fails scrutineering, the driver will be excluded from qualifying but will be allowed to start the race from the back of the grid at the race stewards' discretion.\n\n2021 saw the trialling of a 'sprint qualifying' race on the Saturday of three race weekends, with the intention of testing the new approach to qualifying. The traditional qualifying would determine the starting order for the sprint, and the result of the sprint would then determine the start order for the Grand Prix. The system returned for the 2022 season, now titled the 'sprint'. From 2023, sprint races no longer impacted the start order for the main race, which would be determined by traditional qualifying. Sprints would have their own qualifying session, titled the 'sprint shootout'; such a system made its debut at the 2023 Azerbaijan Grand Prix and is set to be used throughout all sprint sessions in place of the traditional second free practice session. Sprint qualifying sessions are run much shorter than traditional qualifying, and each session required teams to fit new tyres - mediums for SQ1 and SQ2, and softs for SQ3 - otherwise they cannot participate in the session.",
    "Largest Dog Walk Article": "A single dachshund can be so small that you might blink and miss it, but on Sunday, a mass of sausage dogs moved their little feet to achieve an enormous feat.\n\nIn Elwood in Melbourne’s inner south-east, more than 1300 dachshunds and their owners set a Guinness world record for the largest dog walk by a single breed.\n\nSome of the proceeds from the event will go towards operations on foster dachshunds, many of which are affected by a spinal disease.\n\nIn Point Ormond Reserve before the walk, there was a stunt that would be hard to pull off with heavier breeds. Event volunteer Elizabeth Anile asked owners over the PA system to hold up their dachshunds for a drone photo with the Melbourne CBD in the background.\n\n“Wave your sausages in the air like you just don’t care,” Anile said.\n\nAnd then they were off, on a one-kilometre stroll along the Elwood foreshore path.\n\nThe final figure of 1385 dachshunds smashed, by over 300, the previous record of 1029 — set by beagles in Macclesfield, England, on April 22, 2018.\n\nBut in Elwood it wasn’t just the dogs on show. In a nod to the dachshund breed’s German origins, Darren Holley, of Port Melbourne, wore mustard-coloured lederhosen — knee-length breeches — and his friend Kathy Nucara donned a dirndl, or Bavarian folk dress.\n\nHolley, whose mother, Emmy, was born in Germany, brought his dachshund, Fritz von Bismarck, and Nucara brought her dachshunds, Frankie and Hunny.\n\nEva Williams, 5, wore a fairy dress to help her grandparents Lesley and Paul Calverley, of Mooroolbark, and their five dachshunds take part in the record attempt.\n\nEva named all of Lesley’s miniature longhaired cream dachshunds after characters in the children’s series Paw Patrol — Rubble, Chase, Skye, Ryder and Marshall.\n\nLindsay Bryant, from Little River near Werribee, told how his miniature dachshund, Frankie, sometimes tries to herd sheep on his property and is a great mate.\n\nBryant bought Frankie in December 2022 as a gift for his wife, Anne. In over 50 years together, Anne had always wanted a dachshund, but she died two months later. Now, Bryant said, “Everywhere I go, Frankie comes with me.”\n\nOne of the event’s organisers, Adele Gullick, said she was exhilarated at the world record.\n\nThe event was held to raise awareness of the charity Devoted 2 Dachshunds Rescue, which has been involved with 160 dachshund rescues nationally in the past 12 months, compared with 35 in a year, four years ago.\n\nGullick, who fosters dachshunds, said people needed to research the breed before buying.\n\n“People buy them because they are cute and have no idea whatsoever how needy they are, particularly for working people in apartments,” Gullick said.\n\n“Dachshunds can bark a lot and have serious separation anxiety when left alone, and neighbours complain to councils.”\n\nSome owners lack insurance against intervertebral disc disease, which affects many dachshunds. Surgery can cost over $10,000. Some of the money raised on Sunday would go towards operations on foster dogs, Gullick said."
